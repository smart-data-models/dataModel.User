## List of properties  

- `activityType`: The action performed (e.g. Drive). Normative References: [https://schema.org/Action](https://schema.org/Action), [https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#activity-types](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#activity-types), [https://health-lifesci.schema.org/PhysicalActivityCategory](https://health-lifesci.schema.org/PhysicalActivityCategory)  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateActivityEnded`: Activity's end timestamp.  - `dateActivityStarted`: It must be equal to UserActivity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `refAgent`: Reference to the agent (i.e. a person) performing the activity. It may be another NGSI Entity or any `Agent` identified by an URI.  - `refObject`: Reference to the object of the action (e.g. Car1). It may be another NGSI Entity or any `Object` identified by an URI.  - `refTarget`: Reference to the target of the action (e.g. Office1).  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: NGSI Entity type. It has to be UserActivity    
Required properties  
- `activityType`  - `id`  - `refAgent`  - `type`    
This entity represents the current activity performed by a User. It can be used in different scenarios, from modeling social activities on a site (e.g. Federico shares a picture of his dog) to real life activities (e.g. Federico drives his car to work). The model is largely inspired by [https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core). The model represents user activities using the following predicate structure  `(Agent, Verb, Object*, Target*)`, where `Object` and `Target` are optional. The `Agent` is identified by the attribute `refAgent`, the `Verb` is identified by `activityType`, the `Object` is identified by `refObject`, and the `Target` is identified by `refTarget`.

## Example payloads    
#### Activity NGSI-v2 key-values Example    
Here is an example of a Activity in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-v2 when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.  
```json  
{  
  "id": "UserActivity1",  
  "type": "UserActivity",  
  "activityType": "Drive",  
  "description": "User1 drive Car1 to Office1",  
  "dateActivityStarted": "2016-11-30T07:00:00.00Z",  
  "refObject": "Car1",  
  "refTarget": "Office1",  
  "refAgent": "User1"  
}  
```  
#### Activity NGSI-v2 normalized Example    
Here is an example of a Activity in JSON-LD format as normalized. This is compatible with NGSI-v2 when not using options and returns the context data of an individual entity.
