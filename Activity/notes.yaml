notesHeader:
  This entity represents the current activity performed by a User. It can be used in different scenarios, from modeling social activities on a site (e.g. Federico shares a picture of his dog) to real life activities (e.g. Federico drives his car to work). The model is largely inspired by [https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core). The model represents user activities using the following predicate structure  `(Agent, Verb, Object*, Target*)`, where `Object` and `Target` are optional. The `Agent` is identified by the attribute `refAgent`, the `Verb` is identified
  by `activityType`, the `Object` is identified by `refObject`, and the `Target`
  is identified by `refTarget`.
